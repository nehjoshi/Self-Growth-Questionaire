                        Collecting data of over 17,000 participants in Southern California, the ACE test can be used to predict health outcomes based on the frequency of the answers to the questions.
                        The original ACE study was carried out at Kaiser Permanente from 1995 to 1997 with two waves of data collection.

                    He taught techniques that could boost hope and optimism to some of his students, and then compared their mental health to those who hadn't received such skills.
                    The group who scored better were far less likely to develop depression, anxiety and had better health overall.
